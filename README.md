# sea-level-predictor
This project analyzes global sea level changes since 1880 using historical data. It includes creating a scatter plot, fitting two regression lines (one for all data, one from 2000 onward), and predicting sea level rise until 2050. The analysis uses Python libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Scipy.
